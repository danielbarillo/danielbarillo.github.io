## Go serverless, and stress less.

Elva is the next-generation IT company. We are a cloud-native and a fully specialized consultancy on AWS and serverless, the next paradigm in software development. Even our name is a symbol of our focus. Elva is Swedish for ‘eleven’, the number of the greek letter λ (lambda). An homage to the AWS service that started the serverless revolution.
